TODO 3-1: The BaseCommand class has a show_usage method implemented, but the execute method is not 
implemented and is passed on to the child class. Think about why this difference is made.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):

The show_usage method prints the description and the usage of the command while the execute method executes the command.
The key difference would be that the description and the usage can be stored in parameters as a type of string
but the executation cannot.

TODO 3-2: The update_current_path method of the BaseCommand class is slightly different from other methods. 
It has a @classmethod decorator and takes a cls argument instead of self. In Python, this is called a 
class method, and think about why it was implemented as a class method instead of a normal method.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):

Note the the variable 'current_path' is a class variable. When we move the directory, we need to 
update the current_path. If current_path was an instance variable, we need to update the current_path
for all BaseCommand objects. Hence, by implementing current_path as a class variable and update_current_path
as a class method, we can update the class variable easily.

    For example, the MoveCommand class overrides the execute() method to implement
